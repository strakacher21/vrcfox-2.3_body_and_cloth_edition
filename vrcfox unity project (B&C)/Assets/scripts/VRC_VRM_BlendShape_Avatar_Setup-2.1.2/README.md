This unity editor tool is made to auto setup a vrm Blendshape avatar with the blendshapes for:

* Arkit face tracking
* Unified Expressions
* Vrc visemes

[Ritual neo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHuQWPtaw8XLRMIOctBQRQ) was the one who requested this tools construction <br />This was made to save time manualy assigning blendshapes to the Blendshape Avatar <br /> 

This tool is not a silver bullet and has some edge cases that the tool will not work with <br /> I am looking into fixing these issues

## Notes
* Your input blendshapes must be named according to vrchat / arkit / UE naming conventions (Not case sensetive)
* Please verify your avatar. Some avatars have weird/unconventional names for blendshapes
* For extra visemes Vseeface requires all extra visemes to be present [SIL, CH, DD, FF, KK, NN, PP, RR, SS, TH]
* UE to ARkit convertion is currently a BETA feature and may need user tweaking to get everything looking just right
