# Blender Auto FBX Export

A simple addon script for Blender with a dedicated interface attached to the Layout window, allowing you to automatically export models from Blender in FBX format.

## Setup

1. Open the **Text Editor** area in Blender.
2. Load the `Blender auto fbx export.py` script.
3. Enable **Text → Register** in the header menu (this ensures the script runs automatically when the .blend file is opened).
4. Run the script once.

After this, an **FBX Export** panel will appear in the top-right corner of the **3D Viewport** (specifically in the Layout workspace, though you can customize the target window in the code).
